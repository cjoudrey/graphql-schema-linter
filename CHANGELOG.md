## 0.1.1 (February 13th, 2017)

### Bug fixes

- Removed dependency on `graphql-config` until it is actually used.

## 0.1.0 (February 12th, 2017)

### Breaking change

Descriptions must now be defined as strings instead of comments [as outlined in the spec](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/pull/90).

In order to provide a graceful upgrade path, users can use the `--comment-descriptions` option to use the old way of defining descriptions.
